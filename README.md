### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vivek the resident GitHub idiot. A few friends did one of these so now it's my turn I guess. So here it is some waffle about me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : A levels and some Udemy courses
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Basic Cyber Security
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  A lot of things.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with : Everything. I'm pretty dumb.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about : Nothing. I am really dumb so I won't be any help.
- âš¡ Fun fact 1: I am the Undisputed Typo GOD
- âš¡ Fun fact 2: Pepsi once had the sixth largest navy in the world
- âš¡ Fun fact 3: I am really bad at this. 
- ðŸ”Ž Who am I: I am an A level student studying Maths,Physics and Computer Science. Who is hoping to work in Cyber Security
